        <p>I have always loved cooking and baking since I was a little girl and would sit at the counter and help my mom make wedding cakes. While I loved being a School Psychologist, it didn't leave a whole lot of energy for hobbies at home. Now, as a stay-at-home mom, I have the time again to be creative in the kitchen and get back to a beloved hobby. Butternups started as a simple favor for a Young Women's activity and spiraled out from there to weddings and holiday gifts.</p>
